# `semiarrow`

This package (for now) is a companion to

 1. [de Oliveira et al, 2022, *On Structuring Functional Programs with Monoidal Profunctors*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00852.pdf#page=6)
 2. [de Oliveira et al, 2023, *Programming with Monoidal Profunctors and Semiarrows*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4496714)

intended to fill in some of the typos or omitted pieces of implementation and
allow the reader to work with the Haskell contained in those papers or with
analogues defined in existing Haskell packages: the package is not a
self-contained or self-documenting guide to the content of those papers, and
doesn't (for now) contain more than a few basic examples. It does however, give
you some tools to define those examples for yourself. (PRs are welcome!)
